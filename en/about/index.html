              <p>Yanina Klimkovich was born and raised in a small beautiful village, in the suburds of Borisov, Belarus. In the childhood she spent a lot of time outdoors – surrounded by glorious landscapes, atmospheric skies and colourful plants. So it’s really not surprising that she turned to nature for inspiration when she took up painting. Painter draws inspiration from natural forms, organic lines, curves, and nature’s wondrous creations. It is remarkable that Yanina Klimkovich's paintings are imbued with a delicacy of detail and сolor harmony.</p>
              <p>Yanina began her art education at the Republican Boarding School of Music and Fine Arts named after I. Akhremchik, located in Minsk, Belarus. Today it's known as the Republican I. Akhremchik College of Arts. A seven-year study at the department of oil painting at this school gave her a good foundation for further education and creative development as an artist. After that Yanina studied easel, book and applied graphics at The Belarusian State Academy of Arts (BSAA) in Minsk. During her studies she specialized in the field of book graphics. In 1987 she graduated from the graphics department of the Belarusian State Theatre and Art Institute  (now The Belarusian State Academy of Arts). Today the Academy is the most prominent higher-education institution of arts in the Republic of Belarus and it has the status of a leading educational institution of the national system of art.</p>
